<b>Fractals</b>
<p>
The Fractals project was developed by Brian Cochran with help from Leon Tabak and others in CSC-144. This programs creates an image of the Mandelbrot set and draws it on screen. It also continously zooms into the drawn region of the Mandelbrot set. The goal of this project was to learn more about how a large program works and how all the pieces of a large program fit together. This project also encouraged independent research and problem solving as less source code was provided initially.
